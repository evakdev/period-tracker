### Where Are We? ###
### in trackables.html and  forms.py
### forms.py and views.py: 
# trackable/category list on the left gets updated(but only after refresh), while dropdowns dont
# get updated until you rerun the server. How to solve that?
# 
### trackables.html:
#   adding 'done' logic at the top of the page, or render to success page

 

"""
Things to do: 

** Now **
✔ have a db of default trackable things from the start.
✔ Trackable management page: delete, add, edit trackables.
- make trackables a drop down choosable list (in models)
- Change views so that it reads "blood" from codewords including 
  blood (different severities) rather than just one word
- make links a bit more organized and easy to catch
- make it so that we cant add a day or cycle or trackable twice
- after all this, try the app again to find logic faults in views

** Later **
- Make database page pretty --> Once I learn templates
- Add forms so that we can add to db from browser --> Once I learn forms
- Add categories for trackables (not urgent now though)
